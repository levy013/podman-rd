# TODOs
- [ ] Look into quadlets

- [ ] Include a nuget.config file to identify the private stream via URL and credentials.

- [ ] Condense containerization cmds into PS script (make sure script removes .tar after we scp to server)

- [ ] Should we consider setting up a private registry? That way everyone can push/pull from here. We can host this on any server.
